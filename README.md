           The Indian Premier League (IPL), officially Vivo Indian Premier League for sponsorship reasons, is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India contested during April and May of every year by teams representing Indian cities and some states.

IPL has an exclusive window in ICC Future Tours Program. The IPL is the world’s most lucrative domestic cricket tournament, attracting the best players from around the globe. The player auction where the brains trust from each of the eight franchises bid for the right to have that playing talent on their roster. Each club has a salary cap of approx. INR 1cr. to spend on a maximum of 15 players (eight overseas).
The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues. In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to be broadcast live on YouTube.

ABOUT PROJECT ::-
           The proposed system is most useful and effective for the Biding purposes online, as there is no other online biding mechanism for IPL Auction. 
           The traditional way of auction is, making the team owners of all the teams to gather at one place along with the auctioneer(s) and then start the auction or biding. 
           But by this project, it is not compulsory that all of these people have to gather at one place. 
           Since it is an internet based project, so any team owner can bid on any player no matter what his/her location is. 
           And that is the biggest advantage of this system. 
           Along with the biding process; the team owner can also see all the updates in their respective team’s money balance whenever he owns the player. 
           Also, there is an auto-refresh technique to the site; so that there is no need to refresh the page manually.

SCOPE OF THE PROJECT ::-
           Since the premier leagues not just include Cricket, it also includes the Kabaddi, Soccer, Chess, Hockey, Badminton, Basket Ball and many other games. As auctions process includes biding on the player for taking that player in the team and teams can be of Kabaddi player for Kabaddi tournaments, or can be for Basket Ball, this project can work absolutely just fine on any biding system places and biding systems. And here also it holds the same benefits like there is no requirement for the team owners or members as well to come together at a place for biding.
